## Technical Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Server vs Client Components:** Dashboard and detail pages use server components for data loading; search, filters, and interactive components use client components
- **URL-driven State:** Filters persist in URL query params for shareability
- **Static Generation:** All project detail pages pre-rendered with generateStaticParams
- **Pure Functions:** All governance logic (matrix.ts, filters) extracted as pure functions for testability
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Core functionality works without JavaScript (static export)

### Dependencies Added
- `fuse.js` (8KB) - Fuzzy search per PRD Section 7.1
- All other dependencies from initial bootstrap (Next.js, React, Recharts, Zod, gray-matter)

## User Guide

### Dashboard (`/`)

The executive dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of your strategic portfolio:

**Metric Cards:**
- **Total Investment:** Sum of estimated costs across all projects
- **Active Projects:** Count of projects currently in execution
- **Projected ROI:** Sum of expected returns from all projects
- **Portfolio Health:** ROI multiplier (projected returns ÷ investment)

**Visualizations:**
- **Phase Distribution:** Bar chart showing project count by phase (Planning, Execution, Review)
- **Status Breakdown:** Grid showing counts by status (Active, Queued, Backlog, Paused, Complete)

**Activity Feed:** Recent project updates (created, status changes, completions)

**Quick Actions:** Navigate to Matrix View, Roadmap, or Project Library

---

### Strategy Matrix (`/matrix`)

The Strategy Matrix visualizes projects on an Impact vs. Effort grid to identify strategic priorities:

**Quadrants:**
- **Quick Wins** (top-left): High impact, low effort - prioritize these
- **Big Bets** (top-right): High impact, high effort - major initiatives
- **Fillers** (bottom-left): Low impact, low effort - background work
- **Time Sinks** (bottom-right): Low impact, high effort - reconsider these

**Interactions:**
- **Hover:** See project title, quadrant, and ROI in tooltip
- **Click:** Opens modal with full project details
- **Filters:** Use sidebar to filter by Department, Phase, or Status
- **URL Sharing:** Filters persist in URL - share links with teammates

**Interpreting the Plot:**
- X-axis: Effort score (0-100, right = more effort)
- Y-axis: Impact score (0-100, up = more impact)
- Point color indicates quadrant
- Position indicates strategic priority

---

### Roadmap Timeline (`/roadmap`)

The Gantt timeline shows project schedules and dependencies:

**Features:**
- **Timeline Bars:** Each project displayed as horizontal bar
- **Color Coding:** Bar color indicates status (Active=green, Queued=blue, etc.)
- **Today Marker:** Vertical line shows current date
- **Grouping:** Organize by Department, Status, Phase, or None

**Navigation:**
- Select grouping from dropdown
- Hover bars to see project name
- Click bar to navigate to project detail

---

### Project Library (`/projects`)

Browse, search, and filter all projects:

**Search:**
- Fuzzy search by project title, description, department, owner
- Results update as you type
- Powered by Fuse.js for typo tolerance

**Filters:**
- Department (Manufacturing, Engineering, Customer Experience, etc.)
- Phase (Planning, Execution, Review)
- Status (Active, Queued, Backlog, Paused, Complete)
- Filters combine with AND logic (must match all selected)

**View Options:**
- **Grid View:** Card layout with key metrics
- **Table View:** Compact list with sortable columns

**Sorting:**
- Title (A-Z)
- Status

## Tips & Best Practices

### For Consultants

1. **Start with the Matrix:** Get familiar with the strategic landscape
2. **Filter to Your Domain:** Use department filters to focus on your area
3. **Prioritize Quick Wins:** Low-hanging fruit for early momentum
4. **Challenge Time Sinks:** Projects in bottom-right may need rescoping
5. **Use URL Sharing:** Share filtered views with stakeholders

### For Executives

1. **Dashboard First:** Start each day with the executive dashboard
2. **Watch Portfolio Health:** ROI multiplier indicates strategic efficiency
3. **Monitor Active Projects:** Ensure capacity isn't overcommitted
4. **Review Gantt Monthly:** Check for timeline conflicts or resource crunches
5. **Big Bets Need Justification:** High-effort projects must deliver high impact

### For Project Managers

1. **Keep Details Current:** Update project frontmatter regularly
2. **Use Precise Scores:** Impact and Effort scores drive prioritization
3. **Tag Appropriately:** Tags improve searchability
4. **Track Dependencies:** Note blocking projects in details
5. **Update Status:** Active status affects dashboard metrics

---

## Configuration

### Adding New Projects

1. Create markdown file in `_content/projects/`
2. Use PRJ-XXX naming convention
3. Include complete frontmatter (see PRJ-001 for template)
4. Required fields: title, status, department, owner, scores, dates, financials
5. Rebuild to see changes: `npm run build`

### Customizing Tenant

Edit `_content/config.json`:
- `meta`: Branding (title, logo, favicon)
- `features`: Toggle UI components
- `ui`: Design tokens (colors, typography)
- `roadmap`: Capacity limits and phase definitions

### Modifying Quadrant Logic

Logic defined in `src/lib/governance/matrix.ts`:
- `normalizeScore()`: Converts 0-10 to 0-100
- `assignQuadrant()`: Determines quadrant by boundaries

Default boundaries: `[50, 50]`  
To adjust: Update threshold constants in matrix.ts

⚠️ Changing boundaries affects all strategic classifications

## Performance Optimization

### Pre-Deploy Checklist

- [ ] Run production build locally
- [ ] Test all routes in production mode
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit (target >90)
- [ ] Verify bundle size <250KB gzipped
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Check browser console (no errors)

### Monitoring

**Vercel Analytics:**
- Automatic for Vercel deployments
- See Core Web Vitals in dashboard

**Google Analytics:**
Add to `src/app/layout.tsx`:
```tsx
<Script src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA-XXXXX" />
<Script id="google-analytics">
  {`
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
    function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
    gtag('js', new Date());
    gtag('config', 'GA-XXXXX');
  `}
</Script>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Issue:** Tests failing during build
**Solution:** Run `npm test` locally, fix failing tests

**Issue:** TypeScript errors
**Solution:** Run `npm run type-check`, fix type errors

**Issue:** Out of memory
**Solution:** Increase Node memory: `NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096 npm run build`

### Routes Not Working

**Issue:** 404 on `/matrix` or other routes
**Solution:** Ensure hosting supports static routing (SPA mode)

**Issue:** Blank page on deploy
**Solution:** Check basePath in next.config.js matches hosting path

### Slow Build

**Issue:** Build takes >5 minutes
**Solution:** Check for large dependencies, optimize imports

---

## Security

### Recommendations

- [ ] Enable HTTPS (automatic on Vercel/Netlify)
- [ ] Set CSP headers (Content Security Policy)
- [ ] Add .env to .gitignore (no secrets currently)
- [ ] Review dependencies for vulnerabilities: `npm audit`
- [ ] Set up Dependabot for automated updates

### Headers Configuration

**Vercel** - Create `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "X-Frame-Options",
          "value": "SAMEORIGIN"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
          "value": "nosniff"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Track 5: Contributing Guide (OPTIONAL - 10 min)

**Priority:** P2 (Nice to have)  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Output:** `CONTRIBUTING.md`

#### Contributing Guide Content

Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` in project root:

```markdown
# Contributing to Roadmap Engine

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17+
- npm 9.0+
- Git
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Development Setup

```bash
# Fork and clone repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/roadmap-jakujobi.git
cd roadmap-jakujobi

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

---

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
# Update main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or bugfix branch
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 2. Make Changes

- Write code following project conventions (see below)
- Add tests for new functionality

npm run test:coverage

# Type check
npm run type-check

# Lint
npm run lint

# Build verification
npm run build
```

### 4. Commit Changes

Follow conventional commits format:

```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "feat: add project comparison feature"
git commit -m "fix: correct quadrant boundary calculation"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
git commit -m "test: add edge cases for normalization"
git commit -m "refactor: extract filter logic to separate file"

# Commit types
# feat: New feature
# fix: Bug fix
# docs: Documentation only
# test: Adding or updating tests
# refactor: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# perf: Performance improvement
# chore: Maintenance tasks
```

### 5. Push and Create PR

```bash
# Push branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create Pull Request on GitHub
# - Fill in PR template
# - Link related issues
# - Request review
```

---

## Code Conventions

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript (`strict: true` in tsconfig.json)
- Prefer interfaces for object types
- Use type aliases for unions and complex types
- Avoid `any` - use `unknown` if type is truly unknown
- Export types alongside implementation

**Example:**
```typescript
// Good
interface Project {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  status: ProjectStatus;
}

export function processProject(project: Project): ProcessedProject {
  // implementation
}

// Avoid
function processProject(project: any) {
  // implementation
}
```

### React Components

- Use function components (not class components)
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use TypeScript for props
- Extract complex logic to custom hooks
- Keep components focused (single responsibility)

**Example:**
```typescript
// Good
interface ProjectCardProps {
  project: ProcessedProject;
  onClick?: () => void;
}

export function ProjectCard({ project, onClick }: ProjectCardProps) {
  return (
    <Card onClick={onClick}>
      <h3>{project.title}</h3>
      {/* ... */}
    </Card>
  );
}

// Avoid
export default ({ project }: any) => {
  // implementation
};
```

### File Organization

    └── dashboard/        # Page rendering
```

### Testing

**Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
1. Write failing test
2. Make test pass
3. Refactor

**What to Test:**
- ✅ Business logic functions (lib/)
- ✅ Data transformations
- ✅ Validation logic
- ✅ Filter/search algorithms
- ✅ Component rendering (integration)
- ❌ Third-party library behavior
- ❌ Next.js framework internals

**Example Test:**
```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { normalizeScore } from '@/lib/governance/matrix';

describe('normalizeScore', () => {
  it('converts 0-10 score to 0-100 range', () => {
    expect(normalizeScore(5)).toBe(50);
    expect(normalizeScore(10)).toBe(100);
    expect(normalizeScore(0)).toBe(0);
  });

  it('clamps scores below 0', () => {
    expect(normalizeScore(-5)).toBe(0);
  });

  it('clamps scores above 10', () => {
    expect(normalizeScore(15)).toBe(100);
  });
});
```

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use design tokens from config.json
- Avoid inline styles unless dynamic
- Extract repeated patterns to components

**Example:**
```typescript
// Good - Tailwind utilities
<button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 rounded-md text-white">
  Click Me
</button>

// Avoid - inline styles
<button style={{ padding: '8px 16px', background: '#2563eb' }}>
  Click Me
</button>
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Components:** PascalCase (`ProjectCard`, `MatrixTooltip`)
- **Files:** PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- **Functions:** camelCase (`normalizeScore`, `loadProjects`)
- **Constants:** SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_PROJECTS`, `DEFAULT_TENANT`)
- **Types/Interfaces:** PascalCase (`Project`, `MatrixDataPoint`)

---

## Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
npm test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Specific file
npm test -- path/to/file.test.ts
```

### Writing Tests

Use Vitest + React Testing Library:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { ProjectCard } from './ProjectCard';

describe('ProjectCard', () => {
  const mockProject = {
    id: 'PRJ-001',
    title: 'Test Project',
    status: 'Active',
    // ... other required fields
  };

  it('renders project title', () => {
    render(<ProjectCard project={mockProject} />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Test Project')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('shows status badge', () => {
    render(<ProjectCard project={mockProject} />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Active')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Coverage Requirements

- Minimum 80% overall coverage
- New features must include tests
- Bug fixes must include regression tests
- Core logic (lib/) should have 90%+ coverage

---

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments to public functions
- Explain "why" not "what" in comments
- Document complex algorithms
- Include examples for non-obvious APIs

**Example:**
```typescript
/**
 * Normalizes a 0-10 score to 0-100 range for chart display.
 * Clamps out-of-range values to prevent rendering errors.
 *
 * @param score - Raw score from project frontmatter (0-10)
 * @returns Normalized score (0-100)
 *
 * @example
 * normalizeScore(5)  // => 50
 * normalizeScore(10) // => 100
 * normalizeScore(-1) // => 0 (clamped)
 */
export function normalizeScore(score: number): number {
  return Math.max(0, Math.min(100, score * 10));
}
```

---

## Decision Gates

### Gate 1: Screenshot Quality (Minute 15)

**Check:**
- All 8 screenshots captured?
- All key elements visible?
- Good resolution (readable text)?

**Pass:** Continue to PR Description  
**Fail:** Retake missing/poor screenshots (add 5-10 min)

---

### Gate 2: PR Description Complete (Minute 25)

**Check:**
- Template filled completely?
- Time tracking accurate?
- Screenshots referenced?
- Technical notes included?

**Pass:** Continue to Final QA  
**Fail:** Complete missing sections (add 5 min)

---

### Gate 3: QA Checklist (Minute 35)

**Check:**
- All critical items pass (routes, interactions, data)?
- No blocking bugs found?
- Responsive views work?

**Pass:** Create PR immediately  
**Fail:** Fix blocking issues first (reassess timeline)

---

### Gate 4: Time Assessment (Minute 40)

**Check time remaining:**
- **<15 min remaining:** Submit now, skip optional docs
- **15-35 min remaining:** Add user guide only
- **35+ min remaining:** Complete all optional docs

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Screenshot Capture Takes Too Long

**Mitigation:**
- Use browser DevTools screenshot feature (F12 → Cmd+Shift+P → "Capture screenshot")
- Only capture essential views (skip nice-to-haves)
- Lower screenshot resolution if file size issues

**Fallback:** Minimum 4 screenshots (dashboard, matrix, tooltip, mobile)

---

### Risk 2: QA Finds Blocking Bugs

**Mitigation:**
- Triage severity (critical vs. minor)
- Fix critical bugs only
- Document known minor issues in PR

**Fallback:** Submit with note about known issues, plan immediate fix PR

---

### Risk 3: Running Out of Time

**Mitigation:**
- Prioritize critical path (screenshots + PR description)
- Skip optional documentation
- Submit what's complete

**Fallback:** Minimum viable PR = screenshots + basic description

---

## Execution Log (2026-02-15)

### Completed
- **Track 1 (Partial):** 6 of 8 screenshots captured. Original timestamped files in `docs/screenshots/` were copied to required filenames (02-07). Screenshots 01 (dashboard) and 08 (mobile) not in capture set; add if desired for Tier 2 completeness.
- **Track 2:** `docs/PR-DESCRIPTION.md` created with full template. Ready to paste into GitHub when creating PR.
- **Tracks 3-4:** User Guide and Deployment Guide already exist (`docs/USER-GUIDE.md`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`).
- **Track 5:** `CONTRIBUTING.md` exists in repo root.

### Next Steps
1. Run Final QA (Track 6): `npm test`, `npm run build`, manual route check.
2. Create PR on GitHub: Use content from `docs/PR-DESCRIPTION.md`, attach screenshots 02-07 from `docs/screenshots/`.
3. Optional: Capture 01-dashboard-full.png and 08-mobile-responsive.png for Tier 2 completeness.
